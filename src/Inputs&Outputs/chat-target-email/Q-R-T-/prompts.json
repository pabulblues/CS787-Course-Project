She is in good health, eats and sleeps well. However, I am finding it hard to deal with her behaviour. Sometimes she is a dream to spend time with and is happy, relaxed, will do chores if asked, will offer help even when not asked, shes fantastic. Then she will suddenly turn. She will be rude, obusive, shes scream and shout, ignore us, refuse to do things she is asked, this wil then quickly be followed by tears because she is sorry. She says my Husband and I leave her out, which is untrue ( we do however have 2 other children ) she blames school saying she cant do the work or has no friends, also untrue ( have spoken to her teacher at great legnth who assures me she is happy at school, does indeed have friends and is more than capable and happy doing the work that is set ) We have tried reward charts, spending alone time with her, taking things away if she behaves badly but nothing seems to make a difference. I hate seeing her unhappy, but at the same time it frustrates me when she misbehaves for no reason ...... any suggestions on what could be wrong with her ??? Any help would be much appreciated output: Dear parent, she seems that she is trying to Chat Doctor.  I recommend that you stop trying to take actions in response to her actions.  Complete negligence will eventually make her stop these actions\n\ninput: My daughter will be 10 in October. She is in good health, eats and sleeps well.

She will be rude, obusive, shes scream and shout, ignore us, refuse to do things she is asked, this wil then quickly be followed by tears because she is sorry. She says my Husband and I leave her out, which is untrue ( we do however have 2 other children ) she blames school saying she cant do the work or has no friends, also untrue ( have spoken to her teacher at great legnth who assures me she is happy at school, does indeed have friends and is more than capable and happy doing the work that is set ) We have tried reward charts, spending alone time with her, taking things away if she behaves badly but nothing seems to make a difference.

We have had an ongoing personal relationship for almost one year now and I cannot get her out of my head...I can`t sleep at night and have extreme anxiety and depression whenever she is away from me. I know what I am doing is wrong and my mind tells me so but is constantly overruled by my feelings of love for her. I too am married almost 35 years with grown children and some grandkids. It`s all crazy but still I cannot seem to let go. She is all I live for!  Please help me if you can. output: It sounds like you are conflicted about your relationship with this married woman, given that you too, are married. Typically, if you are not getting your needs met in your current marital dead, then you will tend to stray and get your needs met elsewhere. It would appear that your emotional, sexual, or other needs are currently not being met with your wife. If you are this \"obsessive\" with this woman, it would appear that you have been obsessive in other areas of your life or with other women, perhaps even with your wife at one point. At any rate, your situation sounds very complex, and it is difficult to assist you without knowing which aspect of it you want assistance with. It is unclear if you want to terminate the relationship with the other woman, and strengthen your relationship with your wife, or keep things as they are. It would appear that it would be difficult to maintain both relationships and have both be satisfying, given that you are so obsessed with the other woman. I would need more guidance in terms of what your goal is in order to best help you.

I can hardly walk because of my hips or pelvis not sure which.  My body feels twisted and I look lopsided.  In addition my knees, elbows and ankles are swollen and ache severely.  Im very upset I keep crying even though I know it wont help.  I dont know what to do to ease my pain.  Any suggestions? output: Hi, Nothing is impossible, you can have another door opened if one is closed. I advise you to consult a physician for pain management.  Avoid taking potato, other tubers tomato, egg, chicken, and seafoods, as far as possible.  Practice meditation, reading books of your interest, and hearing music.

Since the lupus diagnoses I quit seeing the chiropractor but I am having another joint melt down.  I can hardly walk because of my hips or pelvis not sure which.  My body feels twisted and I look lopsided.  In addition my knees, elbows and ankles are swollen and ache severely.  Im very upset I keep crying even though I know it wont help.  I dont know what to do to ease my pain.  Any suggestions? output: Hi, Nothing is impossible, you can have another door opened if one is closed.

Sometimes she is a dream to spend time with and is happy, relaxed, will do chores if asked, will offer help even when not asked, shes fantastic. Then she will suddenly turn. She will be rude, obusive, shes scream and shout, ignore us, refuse to do things she is asked, this wil then quickly be followed by tears because she is sorry. She says my Husband and I leave her out, which is untrue ( we do however have 2 other children ) she blames school saying she cant do the work or has no friends, also untrue ( have spoken to her teacher at great legnth who assures me she is happy at school, does indeed have friends and is more than capable and happy doing the work that is set ) We have tried reward charts, spending alone time with her, taking things away if she behaves badly but nothing seems to make a difference. I hate seeing her unhappy, but at the same time it frustrates me when she misbehaves for no reason ...... any suggestions on what could be wrong with her ???

Complete negligence will eventually make her stop these actions\n\ninput: My daughter will be 10 in October. She is in good health, eats and sleeps well.
